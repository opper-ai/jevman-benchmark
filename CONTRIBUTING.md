## Benchmark your own model

The [leaderboard](https://opper.ai/jevman-benchmark/leaderboard) has two parts:

- **Our runs.** We play the System One models Opper serves ourselves. If your model is on Opper (or another API we
  can call), open an issue or a pull request adding it to [`shared/models.ts`](shared/models.ts), and we'll run it.
- **Self-reported.** Any other model, private or local included: you run the benchmark yourself and send the games
  in a pull request. CI replays every game and checks its score, and the leaderboard lists your model as
  **self-reported**.

### 1. Put your model behind an HTTP endpoint

At every junction the bench POSTs the same JSON that jevman sends System One:

```json
{
  "state": { "maze": ["…"], "pacman": { "x": 13, "y": 23, "dir": "left" }, "ghosts": { "…": "…" }, "…": "…" },
  "questions": {
    "pacman": {
      "type": "choice",
      "instructions": "You are Pac-Man. …",
      "criteria": { "up": "Go up: nearest pellet 1 step away; …", "left": "Go left: …", "right": "Go right: …" }
    }
  }
}
```

Answer each question with one of its `criteria` keys:

```json
{ "answers": { "pacman": { "type": "choice", "choice": "left", "probabilities": { "left": 0.7, "up": 0.3 } } } }
```

`probabilities` and `confidence` are optional, and so are `usage` (`{ "input_tokens": 812, "output_tokens": 4 }`) and
`costUsd` (what the call cost; the leaderboard shows it per game). Pac-Man can also get a `pacman_escape` question
mid-corridor, with the same shape.

[`scripts/example-endpoint.ts`](scripts/example-endpoint.ts) is a complete endpoint in 34 lines, to copy and put
your model behind. If yours needs a key, set `BENCH_ENDPOINT_TOKEN`: the bench sends it as a bearer token.

The game runs in real time, as on the leaderboard. An answer that takes over 2 seconds is replaced by a simple rule
(a fallback), and Pac-Man waits at the junction until one or the other decides.

### 2. Try it

```bash
npm ci
node --import tsx scripts/example-endpoint.ts   # or start your own endpoint
npm run bench -- --endpoint http://localhost:8787 --games 2
```

### 3. Record the submission

```bash
npm run bench -- --endpoint http://localhost:8787 --submit submissions/my-model --name "My Model" --by your-github-handle --url https://example.com/my-model
```

This plays the leaderboard's games: 24 games, each to game over or 300 seconds, against the scripted ghosts, 4 at a
time (change that with `--parallel`). It writes `submissions/my-model/`, holding `submission.json` and one
`game-NN.json.gz` per game. The folder name is your model's id: lowercase letters, digits and dashes.

Check it the way CI will:

```bash
npm run submissions
```

### 4. Open a pull request

Commit the folder and open a pull request. CI replays every game and refuses the submission if any game breaks a
rule or doesn't replay to its recorded result. Once it's merged, your model shows up on the leaderboard.

### What "self-reported" means

The game is deterministic, so CI replays your recorded moves against the scripted ghosts and recomputes every score,
survival time, pellet and death itself. A submission can't claim more than its moves earned.

What a replay can't check: that your model made those moves, how fast it really answered, how often it fell back,
what it cost, and that you didn't play more games and keep the best ones. (It does check that the moves are ones the
bench could have made: each answer in time, each escape question answered once, and no game sent twice.) Those are as you report them, which is why the leaderboard
marks these entries. Please submit every game of the run.

When the game or the question changes, `BENCH_VERSION` in [`shared/leaderboard.ts`](shared/leaderboard.ts) goes
up. Older submissions then drop off the leaderboard until they're re-run.
